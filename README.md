# HexShares

This is an experimental project that aims to provide a staking pool for HEX.

It is not meant as advocacy of any kind for the HEX project.

## Overview

HEX is a blockchain-based certificate of deposit (CD) that features a unique tokenomics model designed to reward long-term commitment and reduce short-term speculation. The project's native token, HEX, is designed to be staked for a specific period, known as the staking period, to earn rewards. The longer the staking period, the higher the rewards, incentivizing users to think long-term and actively participate in securing the network's stability. By locking up their tokens, stakers demonstrate their commitment to the project and contribute to reducing circulating supply, which can positively impact token value.

This repo contains the source code for the "HexShares" staking pool, which is designed to allow HEX holders to pool their tokens and stake them collectively to maximize rewards. The pool is designed to be non-custodial, meaning that users retain full control over their tokens and can withdraw them at any time. The pool's smart contract is designed to distribute rewards to participants based on their share of the pool, which is determined by the amount of HEX they contribute.
